But these models have a limited forecast horizon. The availability of meteorological data offers an opportunity for data scientists to improve sub-seasonal forecasts by blending physics-based forecasts with machine learning.\n","\n","Sub-seasonal forecasts for weather and climate conditions (lead-times ranging from 15 to more than 45 days) would help communities and industries adapt to the challenges brought on by climate change.\n","\n","In this project,focus on longer-term weather forecasting to help communities adapt to extreme weather events caused by climate change by generating forecasts of temperature and precipitation for one year.\n","\n","# 1.2) Objectives\n","## a) Main objective\n","The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that will forecast sub-seasonal temperatures (temperatures over a two-week period) within the United States.\n","\n","## b) Specific objectives\n","\n","1.
